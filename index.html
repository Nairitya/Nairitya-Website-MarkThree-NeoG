          <p>
            My technical expertise lies in modern web development, utilizing a
            range of cutting-edge technologies. I have a strong foundation in
            <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and
            <strong>JavaScript</strong>, which forms the backbone of any dynamic
            and interactive web application. <br />Additionally, I am also
            familiar with using <strong>ReactJS</strong>, a popular JavaScript
            library for building user interfaces, and <strong>NodeJS</strong>, a
            server-side runtime environment.

          <h2>Additional Skills</h2>
          <p>
            In addition to web development, I have a diverse range of skills
            that enhance my abilities as a developer and make me a valuable
            asset to any team. Some of these additional skills include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>UX/UI design</strong>: I have a strong understanding of
              user-centered design principles and a keen eye for aesthetics. I
              am proficient in tool such as <em>Figma</em>, and I know how to
              design interfaces that are both visually appealing and easy to
              use.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Vector graphics</strong>: I have a deep understanding of
              vector graphics and know how to use <em>Adobe Illustrator</em> to
              create high-quality designs for a variety of purposes, such as
              logos, icons, illustrations, and infographics.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Sketching</strong>: I have a passion for creativity and
              have honed my skills in sketching, which I believe adds another
              dimension to my abilities as a web developer. I understand the
              importance of <em>iteration</em> and know how to use sketching as
              an iterative process to refine and improve designs.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            By combining my these skills with web development , I can bring a
            unique and creative perspective to any project that I work on

          <h2>My Blogs</h2>
          <p>
            As a web developer, I learnt that staying up-to-date with the latest
            industry trends and best practices is really important. That's why I
            try to write and share my learnings through my blog. I am not an
            expert in writing blogs, but do check them out and give me feedback
            if any.
